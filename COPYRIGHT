This Lua module was ported from the Perl Image::Size module by
Geoff Richards.  The Lua port and documentation is Copyright (c) 2008
Geoff Richards <geoff@geoffrichards.co.uk>.

The original Perl module was written by Randy J. Ray
<rjray@blackperl.com>, based on image-sizing code by Alex Knowles
<alex@ed.ac.uk> and Andrew Tong <werdna@ugcs.caltech.edu>,
used with their joint permission.

Many bug fixes and patches were provided by other people.  See the
documentation for the Image::Size Perl module for details.
